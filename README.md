# Capstone2-Supervised-Learning

As part of the curriculum for Thinkful, in the Supervised Learning module we must now create a supervised learning model.  The assignment was to select a dataset of interest and develop an outcome of interest.  Then we had to explore the data, clean the data and understand the intricacies of the data in order to model the outcome.  

After that, we needed to build several models and compare their performance, select the "best" model and then create a presentation summarizing the process, the selection rationale and what, if any, improvements could be made to enhance the model.  

For this I choose the dataset from the Kiva microlending platform.  As a lender on the platform, I was curious to model the amount that a borrower could expect from Kiva and what features were the most important to successfuly get funded.  

I have included the external data and notebook however because the Kiva dataset is too large to upload, I am including a link below.  

Kiva dataset too big to upload so this is dropbox link: https://www.dropbox.com/s/86gxoi03z2yofp1/kiva_loans.csv.zip?dl=0
